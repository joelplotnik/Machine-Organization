Machine Org/ Assembly Language

An introduction to Assembly Language programming. Language syntax is covered, together with a study of the instruction set mnemonics, segment, index, pointer, general purpose and flag registers. A variety of memory addressing techniques are covered, as well as stack operations, particularly those associated with passing parameters to subroutine calls. Also includes I/O to screen, printer, and disk interfaces. Emphasis is placed on interaction between the code and the operating system's supplied functions for I/O to peripheral devices. Use of editor and debugging tools are addressed.
