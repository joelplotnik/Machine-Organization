Hangman game. A program that will read from a random word from a text file (dictionary.txt) containing English words (one word per line). 
The program continues to ask the user for a letter until the user has either guessed all the letters in the word, or until the word H-A-N-G-M-A-N 
has been completely filled out, whichever comes first. Using bread board connected to Raspberry Pi, ring buzzer for each incorrect guess.  
After each guess, print out the letters correctly guessed and the letters in H-AN-G-M-A-N opened as a consequence of missed guesses.
